With the Bell of Shard Bow, you will summon a white divine bow, they penetrate anything it hits
there are two uses for this bow,

1. one you leap backwards into the air and shoot a single explosive arrow where you aim at, the explosion is 15 feet in a ball, and deals 1D10 damage, and the explosion deals 1D6 damage
2. two you leap upwards before firing 3 explosive arrows under you, all arrows deal the same damage except the 3rd one that deals 2d10 damage and 1d4 damage explosion, dont feel safe tho, as the third arrow will toss you 15 feet into the air, making you in total 20 feet in the air, there is no reduced fall damage.


you can use this bell once per short rest
